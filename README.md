# Useful Stuff

This repository contains a collection of useful Tutorials and Technical Know-hows for a variety of problems that I encountered along the way with coding. I mostly wrote this to myself, although I would be more than happy if something in this repo could make someone's life easier. 

## Markdowns
1. Setting up a virtual machine on Google-Cloud-Platform (GCP) for Reinforcement Learning (RL) experiments with Python, specifically with the Gym and Atari libraries.
	- [Create a GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Create_a_GCP_VM_Instance.md)
	- [Install Python on a Linux GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Install_Python_on_a_Linux_GCP_VM_Instance.md)
	- [Initiate Jupyter Notebook on a GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Initiate_Jupyter_Notebook_on_a_GCP_VM_Instance.md)
	- [Clone a Github Repository to a GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Clone_a_Github_Repository_to_a_GCP_VM_Instance.md)
	- [Install Gym and Atari libraries with ROMs on a GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Install_Gym_and_Atari_libraries_with_ROMs_on_a_GCP_VM_Instance.md)

	
## Scripts
1. Creating a requirements.txt file for a python project (without virtual environment) by parsing the project source code and reading out all the imported packages which are not python standard library packages or not self created packages. The scipt creates the requirements.txt file in the given path. **API**: run in terminal with the next command <br> ```python3 create_requirements_from_src.py <full-path-to-project-source-folder>```
	- [create requirements from src](Scripts/create_requirements_from_src.py)
