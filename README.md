# Useful Stuff

This repository contains a collection of useful Tutorials and Technical Know-hows for a variety of problems that I encountered along the way with coding. I mostly wrote this to myself, although I would be more than happy if something in this repo could make someone's life easier. 

## Markdowns
1. Setting up a virtual machine on Google-Cloud-Platform (GCP) for Reinforcement Learning (RL) experiments with Python, specifically with the Gym and Atari libraries.
	- [Create a GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Create a GCP VM Instance.md)
	- [Install Python on a Linux GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Install Python on a Linux GCP VM Instance.md)
	- [Initiate Jupyter Notebook on a GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Initiate Jupyter Notebook on a GCP VM Instance.md)
	- [Clone a Github Repository to a GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Clone a Github Repository to a GCP VM Instance.md)
	- [Install Gym and Atari libraries (with ROMs) on a GCP VM Instance](Markdowns/Install Gym and Atari libraries (with ROMs) on a GCP VM Instance.md)

	
## Scripts
1. Creating a requirements.txt file for a python project (without virtual environment) by parsing the project source code and reading out all the imported packages which are not python standard library packages of not self created packages. 
	- [create requirements from src](Scripts/create_requirements_from_src.py)
